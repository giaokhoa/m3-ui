# Material 3 layout foundation

This directory owns Material 3 layout contracts and layout components for the web. It is not a generic CSS utility framework and it does not translate the Compose layout runtime.

## Source ownership

```text
layout/
├─ adaptive/       Material window classes, posture, pane directives and adapted values
├─ components/     Material layout components and canonical scaffolds
└─ index.ts        public layout barrel
```

`src/components/` is reserved for Material UI widget families. Screen/pane composition primitives belong in `src/layout/components/`, even when they are re-exported from the package root for API compatibility.

`Scaffold` is owned by `layout/components/Scaffold`. The legacy `src/components/Scaffold` path is only a compatibility source barrel and must not contain implementation or styles. Internal code should import the canonical layout path.

## Upstream layers

Material layout in Compose is split across layers:

- `androidx.compose.foundation.layout`: low-level mechanics such as Box, Row, Column, Flow layouts, FlexBox and Grid.
- `androidx.compose.material3.Scaffold`: Material screen slots and insets.
- `androidx.compose.material3.adaptive`: window adaptive information.
- `androidx.compose.material3.adaptive.layout`: pane directives, pane adaptation and canonical multi-pane scaffolds.

For the browser, Flexbox, Grid, logical properties and layout-viewport measurement are the native equivalents of the first layer. Public wrappers such as `Box`, `Row` or `Column` should only be added when they provide a stable semantic contract beyond CSS itself.

The Material-specific adaptive contract is different: its breakpoint classes, partition counts, pane gaps, preferred sizes, posture handling and canonical layouts are design decisions. Those are ported and tested here.

## Current parity

The foundation currently ports the pinned AndroidX behavior for:

- V2 width size classes: Compact, Medium, Expanded, Large and Extra Large.
- Height size classes: Compact, Medium and Expanded.
- `WindowAdaptiveInfo`-equivalent data and an SSR-safe browser hook.
- `calculatePaneScaffoldDirective`.
- `calculatePaneScaffoldDirectiveWithTwoPanesOnMediumWidth`.
- Explicit folding posture and hinge policies without inventing a browser posture API.
- Static Hide/Reflow `calculateThreePaneScaffoldValue` adaptation used by canonical layouts.
- `ThreePaneScaffold` measurement and placement: pane priority, preferred sizes, RTL order, physical hinge partitions and vertical reflow.
- `ListDetailPaneScaffold` with List → Detail → Extra logical order.
- `SupportingPaneScaffold` with Main → Supporting → Extra order and Supporting → Main reflow strategy.
- Material `Scaffold`, implemented with CSS Grid, logical properties and safe-area environment variables.

Immutable layout metrics live in canonical DTCG under `packages/tokens/tokens/core/layout.json`; adaptive code only projects generated `@m3-ui/tokens` values.

## Web mapping rules

Android `dp` layout thresholds map to CSS pixels because both are logical, density-independent layout units. Device pixels are never used for Material window classification.

`useWindowAdaptiveInfo` observes the layout viewport (`document.documentElement`), not `visualViewport`, so virtual keyboards and visual zoom do not incorrectly change the application layout class. Consumers that have reliable fold/hinge information can pass it explicitly as `WindowPosture`.

`ThreePaneScaffold` uses a pure measurement function plus DOM placement. This is intentional: AndroidX pane allocation is not equivalent to equal CSS grid fractions. Each expanded pane starts from its preferred width; surplus width goes to the highest-priority visible pane (Primary → Secondary → Tertiary), while constrained layouts scale preferred widths proportionally. Physical hinge bounds partition the available surface before that allocation. The pure calculator keeps these rules independently testable instead of hiding them in React effects.

Layout components should prefer CSS Grid/Flexbox and logical properties over JavaScript measurement whenever the browser can express the Material contract natively. JavaScript measurement is used only where AndroidX itself applies a measurement algorithm that CSS cannot reproduce exactly from static declarations.

## Deliberate next slices

AndroidX `Levitate` adaptation, pane-expansion drag state, pane-resize handles and animated lookahead/motion are not treated as static layout. They need explicit browser overlay, focus, pointer and motion contracts and should be added as separate parity slices rather than approximated inside the foundation placement engine.

Generic `Box`/`Row`/`Column` wrappers remain deferred until they demonstrate semantic/API value beyond native CSS Flexbox/Grid.
